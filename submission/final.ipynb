    "# Introduction to Dataset\n",
    "## Data Description\n",
    "**Data Source:** Our data was sourced from my (Nate Teuber) brother who was very gracious and gave us access to his CGM and Insulin Pump data (See below).\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset we are using is comprised of 2.5 years of insulin dosage, blood glucose (bg), and Estimated Variability of Glucose (EVG). This data was collected from a type 1 diabetic's insulin pump and continuous glucose monitor (CGM). Unfortunately this data isnt entirely continous over the 2.5 year span and has gaps in some instances. This data has been exported directly from 30 day span .csv files containing 3 tables one for insulin dosage (bolus), bg, and EVG data. We split these files into the 3 respective tables and saved them to new tables containing the full time-span of data, these files are titles Bolus.csv, BG.csv, and EVG.csv. Here I will detail the contents of these files.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Bolus\n",

    "\n",
    "### Methodology for Data Preprocessing\n",
    "Given the nature of our Time Series problem, after initial testing we identified some issues with the bolus data not being recorded at consistent intervals and only when administering insulin. To remedy this given that our EVG data is continous we decided to fill the gaps in our data with blank bolus records, only adding a 'Type' field equal to 'EVG', to denote the different types of records, and also adding the BG readings while setting the rest of the numeric fields to 0 and categorical fields to blank. \n",
    "Below I detail the preprocessing process and outline the methods used.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Data Import and Initial Setup**\n",
    "* Loading Data:\n",
    "  * We decided to use the `EVG.csv` and `Bolus.csv` files as pandas DataFrames.\n",
    "  * In the function `convert_data(df):` we prepare the `EVG` data by mapping it to match the `Bolus` table structure for consistent formatting across datasets.\n",
    "* Merging Tables:\n",
    "  * We merged the `EVG` and `Bolus` tables into a single dataset using pandas' `concat` function filling the gaps in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Data Cleaning**\n",
    "* Datetime Conversion:\n",
    "  * Converted the `CompletionDateTime` column to the dataframe index.\n",
    "  * Rounded the `CompletionDateTime` to the nearest 5-minute interval to standardize timestamps.\n",
    "  * Identified and removed rows where the `CompletionDateTime` overlapped with `CGM` data to avoid redundancy or conflicting records.\n",
    "  * Dropped all data before 2024 to ensure continous data throughout the set.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Data Transformation**\n",
    "  * Applied one-hot encoding to categorical columns, such as `Type`, `BolusType`, `BolusDeliveryMethod`, and `CompletionStatusDesc`, to prepare them for machine learning models.\n",
    "    * We considered using encodings to map categorical values but resorted to one-hot encoding as it was more familiar to us.\n",
    "  * Removed columns that were not relevant or consistently populated (`SerialNumber`, `BolexStartDateTime`, `BolexCompletionDateTime`, etc.).\n",
    "  * Converted boolean columns to integer type for min-max scaling.\n",
    "  * Re-ordered columns and set the Date value as the Dataframe index.\n",
    "  * Ensured no missing values (`NaN`) remained in the dataset.\n",
    "  * Normalized the data using `MinMaxScaler` to normalize numeric fields to a range of [0, 1].\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Function Descriptions\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. `round_to_nearest_5_minutes(df)`**\n",
    "* Purpose: To ensure all timestamps (`CompletionDateTime`) in the dataset are standardized by rounding them to the nearest 5-minute interval.\n",
    "* Steps:\n",
    "  1. Converts the `CompletionDateTime` column to datetime format.\n",
    "  2. Drops rows with invalid or missing datetime values.\n",
    "  3. Rounds valid `CompletionDateTime` values to the nearest 5-minute interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. `remove_cgm_on_time_overlap(df)`**\n",
    "* Purpose: To remove redundant or conflicting data points from the dataset when multiple records share the same timestamp.\n",
    "* Steps:\n",
    "  1. Identifies duplicate `CompletionDateTime` entries across the dataset.\n",
    "  2. Filters out rows where the `Type` is `CGM` and the timestamp overlaps with other records.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. `convert_data(df)`**\n",
    "* Purpose: To map the structure of the `EVG` table to match the `Bolus` table schema, enabling consistent formatting and integration.\n",
    "* Steps:\n",
    "  1. Creates a template `Bolus` table structure with predefined columns.\n",
    "  2. Renames relevant columns in the `EVG` data to align with the `Bolus` schema.\n",
    "  3. Adds missing columns to the mapped `EVG` table, using default values for both numeric and categorical fields.\n",
    "  4. Reorders the columns to match the `Bolus` table structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. `onehot_encoding(df)`**\n",
    "* Purpose: To transform specified categorical columns into one-hot encoded vectors.\n",
    "* Steps:\n",
    "  1. Uses pandas' `get_dummies()` method to create binary indicator columns for each category in the specified columns.\n",

However, sources online, as well as our professor, informed us that our problem was better framed as a \"Time Series\" problem and that Neural Networks are excellently suited for tackling these kinds of problems. We will get to Neural Networks and the model we chose in a minute, but first, what is a Time Series?\n",
    "\n",
    "*GeeksforGeeks* defines a Time Series as, \"a sequence of data points collected, recorded, or measured at successive, evenly-spaced time intervals.\" Most of our data certainly fits this criteria. We have a long record of various biological data collected over the course of eight months at intervals of five minutes. However, some of our data was recorded at irregular time intervals. We address this later in our section on Data Preprocessing, but we ultimately decided to merge the two datasets and the round the irregular time records to the nearest five-minute mark. This way, we have consistent intervals, and by sacrificing some precision in timing, we gain a wealth of information about food consumption times, carbs consumed, insulin delivered, etc.\n",

    "* **Seasonality**: Periodic patterns that occur at regular intervals in the data. An example would be daily changes in temperature or even changes in temperature over the course of the four seasons.\n",
    "* **Cycles**: Long-term fluctuations which do not have a fixed period. An example would be market boom and bust cycles. These consistently happen, but not at regular intervals.\n",

    "### Recurrent Neural Networks\n",
    "So, addressing this problem as a Time Series seems to be appropriate. What kind of model should we use to make predictions on this series? Our professor suggested Neural Networks, and further research lead us to discover Recurrent Neural Networks in particular. The basic idea of an RNN is this: Imagine someone hands you a picture of a cube (with no background or anything) and asks you to predict which direction it will travel next. Obviously, you'd just be guessing. But if someone handed you a sequence of pictures of the cube over time, you could take a reasonable guess. This applies to an RNN. The point of an RNN is that it keeps track of previous states as sequential patterns, just like the sequence of pictures of the cube, and just like a Time Series. That way, it can make better predictions. However, RNNs suffer from very short-term memory. By the end of the sequence you have fed the RNN, it gives equal weight to the current step in the sequence it's on and all previous steps prior. This results in an exponential loss."

    "### RNNs Improved: Long-Short Term Memory\n",
    "By adding extra functions and steps to the \"hidden state\" in the RNN which keeps track of the prior states, data scientists have been able to create much longer memory for the RNN, which is crucial for our dataset comprised of data recorded at 5-minute intervals spanning over months. There are a few versions of these improved RNNs, but the most popular ones are Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) models and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) models. For this project, we have decided to go with the LSTM, simply because there seems to be more readily available info out there on this type of model."

A link is in the credits section in this notebook. We used the *multivariate* version of his implementation because we want to input multiple features into our LSTM. The function below is directly from his tutorial and most of our LSTM's implementation was a direct modification of his code. Our data preparation was also informed by his tutorial."

If we leave it at default, we can then see, once we print the head of the dataframe, that it has output two timesteps for each variable. For variable 1, our blood glucose level as shown in the code cell above, there is var1(t-1) and var1(t). If you run the code cell below, you will notice that the time series var1(t-1) is the same series as var1(t) except that the entire series is offset one step into the past. This is the same for every one of the variables / features.\n",

So, are we overfitting? Although the graph makes it seem like there is a gap between the plots, the scale of the loss on the y-axis is tiny. The true gap is only about 0.01 to 0.005. So, we do not appear to be overfitting.\n",

    "##### **MAE vs. RMSE**\n",
    "In his original tutorial, Jason used RMSE as his measurement of the performance of the dataset. MAE is, however, significantly easier to understand intuitively. So, we wanted to use MAE, but RMSE is better at finding significant errors, which is especially important since we are trying to predict human blood glucose levels. Luckily, we can use both to gain a better understanding of our dataset.\n",

    "According to EUMeTrain.org, an international training project for the development of training material and training support in the field of satellite meteorology:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"The MAE and the RMSE can be used together to diagnose the variation in the errors in a set of forecasts. The RMSE will always be larger or equal to the MAE; the greater difference between them, the greater the variance in the individual errors in the sample. If the RMSE=MAE, then all the errors are of the same magnitude. Both the MAE and RMSE can range from 0 to ∞. They are negatively-oriented scores: Lower values are better.\"\n",

Compared to our random selection baseline, MAE and RMSE were about half the size of random selection (MAE=8.742, RMSE=9.760, Variance=1.018). In other words, our model was about twice as accurate as random selection. However, our variance is actually higher than baseline by about 0.5. Compared to our mean selection baseline, MAE and RMSE were also about half the size of mean selection. In other words, our model was about twice as accurate as mean selection (MAE=8.778, RMSE=9.746, Variance=0.968). However, our variance is actually higher than baseline by about 1.1. It is somewhat unsurprising that selecting for the mean had the lowest variance, as it is the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is somewhat concerning that our variance is worse, but still, our variance is very low, and so it is unlikely that very large errors have occur. MAE tells us that the average difference between the forecasted BG level and the observed was 5.8 mg/dL. The monitor our data came from records BG level in a range from 0 to 400 mg/dL. Our MAE of 5.816 is only about 2.1% ((5.816 / 400) * 100 = 1.454). So, on average, our model's predicted BG level is only about 1.5% off of the actual level."

    "### Are we overfitting? Underfitting? How do we tell?\n",
    "\n",
    "From our research of the LSTM model one of the best indications to **Overfitting** and **Underfitting** is the use of a Loss Curve. They provide a visual representation of how well the model learns from the training data and generalizes to unseen validation data. For sequential models like LSTMs, which are sensitive to patterns in time-series data, loss curves can reveal: If the model captures the underlying structure of the data; Whether the model is overfitting to the training set or underfitting, failing to learn effectively; How efficiently the model is converging during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Interpreting Overfitting and Underfitting for LSTM w/ Loss Curves\n",
    "To determine if an LSTM model is overfitting or underfitting, specific patterns in the loss curves can be examined:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Overfitting:\n",
    "   * Divergence Between Training and Validation (Test) Loss.\n",
    "   * A noticeable gap between training and validation loss indicates the model is memorizing the training data instead of learning its patterns.\n",
    "   * This would mean that the model is failing to generalize to unseen data, reducing its practicallity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Underfitting:\n",
    "   * Both training and validation losses stay high and dont significantly decrease over epochs.\n",
    "   * If both losses follow a similar trend, but at relatively high values, showing the model is unable to learn the data effectively.\n",
    "   * This means the model lacks the capacity to capture the complexity of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Optimal Outcomes:\n",
    "   * Both training and validation losses decrease together and eventually stabilize at low values.\n",
    "   * The validation loss is slightly higher than the training loss but closely follows its trend, this indicates solid generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Results for Our Model\n",
    "In our case, the loss curves for both training and validation datasets show steady decreases over the epochs, for both losses stabilizing at low values.\n",
    "Specifically: \n",
    "* Training Loss: Decreases steadily to approximately 0.0604\n",
    "* Validation Loss: Closely follows the training loss, decreasing to approximately 0.0565 with no signs of divergence.\n",
    "\n",
    "This Indicates that our model:\n",
    "1. Is not overfitting: The validation loss does not increase or plateau while the training loss decreases.\n",
    "2. Is not underfitting: Both losses decrease and stay at low values, suggesting that the model has effectively learned the patterns in our data.\n",
    "3. Is well-trained and generalizes effectively to unseen data.\n",
    "4. It captures the temporal dependencies in the time-series data without overfitting.\n",
    "5. Has good training stability seen through the steadiness of curves between both losses.\n",
    "6. The lower validation loss could be the result of differing noise levels in the training and testing sets.\n"

Batch size determines how many samples from our dataset the LSTM uses to compare itself to the prediction and calculate error. So we are going to test a batch size of varying intervals. Another hyperparameter is the number of epochs, which is the number of times the LSTM interates over the entire training dataset. Finally, we have the number of neurons in the LSTM. This effectively controls the number of hidden states the LSTM will use to \"remember\" previous states.\n",

    "We found that an LSTM would work best for our Time Series dataset problem. We used an LSTM and got an outcome twice as good as random and simple mean-prediction. We found that the best number of timesteps was 5. In other words, the model was best at predicting BG level when it was given data from the last 25 minutes (five 5 minute intervals.) With an MAE of 5.527, we somewhat improved upon our previous MAE of 5.816 using the timestep optimizer. Hyperparameter tests were inconclusive due to time limitations."
