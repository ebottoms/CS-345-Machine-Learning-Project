    "**NATE**: Apologies for the small amount of code, but I spent tonight doing a lot of research on Time Series, Pandas' implementation of it, and also the type of machine learning model the professor recommended us to use. He recommended using a type of Neural Network called a \"Recurrent Neural Network\" or RNN. Essentially the idea is this; imagine someone hands you a picture of a cube (no background or anything) and asks you to predict which way it will go next. Obviously you'll just be guessing. But if someone handed you a sequence of pictures of the cube over time, you could take a reasonable guess. This applies to an RNN. The point of an RNN is that it keeps track of previous states, just like the sequence of pictures of the cube. That way, it can make better predictions. However, RNNs suffer from very short-term memory. So, there are more advanced ones called Long-Short Term Memory models or LSTMs. Sufficed to say, they somehow fix the issue somewhat. Anyway, we need this since we have long time periods and also because we want to be able to predict based on the last few hours of information, like getting data from the last 24 hours before making a prediction of BG level. So, I've been following this tutorial (https://machinelearningmastery.com/multivariate-time-series-forecasting-lstms-keras/). I'm about halfway through. After it's done, We will do a bunch of hyper parameter tweaks, etc. Rn, the input into the model is gonna be the last 24 hours of BG levels, InsulinDelivered, FoodDelivered, and CarbSize. We can also tweek the amount of hours back the data goes to adjust the accuracy of the model. Anyway, give me any feedback you have, and lemmino if you think there are better input variables. The ones I just listed just seemed the most usable to me because none are categorical and they are within the Bolus dataset which has a ton of entries. Plus they seem intuitively like decent predictors. Anyway, text me anything about it. This should be mostly done by tonight (12/5/24)."
